/**
 * Annotation used to indicate when value of the annotated property (when
 * used for a field, method or constructor parameter), or all 
 * properties of the annotated class, is to be serialized.
 * Without annotation property values are always included, but by using
 * this annotation one can specify simple exclusion rules to reduce
 * amount of properties to write out.
 *<p>
 * Note that inclusion criteria is checked on <b>Java object level</b>
 * and <b>NOT</b> on JSON output -- so even with {@link Include#NON_NULL}
 * it is possible that JSON null values are output, if object reference
 * in question is not `null`. An example is {@link java.util.concurrent.AtomicReference}
 * instance constructed to reference <code>null</code> value: such a value
 * would be serialized as JSON null, and not filtered out.
 * In such cases {@link Include#NON_EMPTY} should be used instead, since missing
 * reference (that is, reference to Java null) is considered "empty" (it is also
 * considered "default", so match {@link Include#NON_DEFAULT}).

         *   was added in Java 1.6 and as such can not be used by Jackson
